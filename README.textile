h1. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Application for Devise with Mongoid)! Rails App for Devise with Mongoid

Rails 3.2 example application shows how to use Devise with Mongoid.

* "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.
* MongoDB is used as a datastore with the "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/  gem for quick development without schemas or migrations.

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-mongoid-devise.html to show how it's built.

You can clone this app or generate a new Rails application using an "application template":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates.

h2. !http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/t_logo-a.png(Follow on Twitter)!:http://www.twitter.com/rails_apps Follow on Twitter

Follow the project on Twitter: "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps. Please tweet some praise if you like what you've found.

h2. Tutorial

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the GitHub wiki:

h4. "View the Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-mongoid-devise.html

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. See a list of recommended resources for "Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails.html.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

This is a demonstration application that allows you to visit a home page and see a list of users. With the default user's email and password (supplied below), you can log in and view details for each user. You can customize this app as you need.

h4. RailsApps Examples and Tutorials

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.com/. See a list of additional "Rails examples, tutorials, and starter apps":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-examples-tutorials.html.

|_. Author |_. Example App |_. Comments |
| Plataformatec | "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise_example | Simple example using SQLite |
| Daniel Kehoe | "Devise, RSpec, Cucumber":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber | Detailed tutorial, app template, starter app, using SQLite |
| Daniel Kehoe | "OmniAuth, Mongoid":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-omniauth | Detailed tutorial, app template, starter app, using MongoDB |

h2. Dependencies

Before running this app, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2
* A working installation of "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ (version 1.6.0 or newer)

See "Installing Rails 3.2":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for detailed instructions and advice.

h4. Installing MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed on your computer, you'll need to install it and set it up to be always running on your computer (run at launch). On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to install "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then run the following:

<pre>
brew install mongodb
</pre>

Homebrew will provide post-installation instructions to get MongoDB running. The last line of the installation output shows you the MongoDB install location (for example, */usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/1.8.0-x86_64*). You'll find the MongoDB configuration file there. After an installation using Homebrew, the default data directory will be */usr/local/var/mongodb*.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code.

h4. Fork, Clone, or Generate?

_Fork:_ If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

_Clone:_ If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below).

_Generate:_ If you want to use the project as a starter app for your customized application, use the application template to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application (described below) gives you many options.

h4. Clone the Repository

If you simply wish to examine the example code, you can download the code ("clone the repository") with the command

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise.git
</pre>

The source code is managed with Git (a version control system). You'll need Git on your machine (install it from "http://git-scm.com/":http://git-scm.com/).

h4. Using the Ready-Made Application Template

You can use an application template to generate a new version of the example app. You’ll find an application template for this app in the "Rails Application Templates":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates repository.

MongoDB must be installed and running on your computer before you use the application template to generate the app.

To build the "rails3-mongoid-devise" example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-mongoid-devise-template.rb -T -O
</pre>

Use the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

This creates a new Rails app (with the name @myapp@) on your computer.

The application generator templates will ask you for various preferences.

To reproduce the example application exactly as found in the repository, make the following selections:

* Would you like to use "Haml":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haml instead of ERB? *no*
* Would you like to use "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ instead of TestUnit? *yes*
* Would you like to use "factory_girl":https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl for test fixtures with RSpec? *yes*

* Would you like to use "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/ for your BDD? *yes*
* Would you like to use "Guard":http://intridea.com/posts/hire-a-guard-for-your-project to automate your workflow? *no*
* Would you like to use Mongoid to connect to a MongoDB database? *yes* 
* Would you like the app to use a Gmail account to send email? *yes*
* Would you like to use "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for authentication? *#2*
## No

## None
## "Zurb Foundation":http://foundation.zurb.com/
## "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ (less)
## "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ (sass)
## "Skeleton":http://www.getskeleton.com/
## Normalize CSS for consistent styling
* Which form gem would you like? *#1*
## None
## simple form
## simple form (bootstrap)
* Would you like to use "rails-footnotes":https://github.com/josevalim/rails-footnotes during development? *no*
* Would you like to set a robots.txt file to ban spiders? *yes*
* Would you like to add 'will_paginate' for pagination? *no*
* Add 'therubyracer' JavaScript runtime (for Linux users without node.js)? *no*

You can choose other selections if you don’t care about matching the example application exactly.

h4. Use "Recipes" to Customize an Application Template

The "tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-mongoid-devise.html shows how a customized application template can be assembled from "recipes." The application template was created using the "Rails Apps Composer":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer gem which provides a convenient way to assemble a reusable application template by selecting various "recipes" for popular Rails development packages.

h4. Please Remember: Edit the README

If you're open sourcing the app on GitHub, please edit the README file to add a description of the app and your contact info. Changing the README is important if you're using a clone of the example app. I've been mistaken (and contacted) as the author of apps that are copied from my example.

h2. Getting Started

h4. About Required Gems

The application uses the following gems:

* "rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails
* "rspec-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-rails
* "database_cleaner":http://rubygems.org/gems/database_cleaner
* "factory_girl_rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/factory_girl_rails
* "cucumber-rails":http://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber-rails
* "capybara":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara
* "mongoid":http://rubygems.org/gems/mongoid
* "bson_ext":http://rubygems.org/gems/bson_ext
* "devise":http://rubygems.org/gems/devise

h4. Install the Required Gems

Install the required gems on your computer:

@$ bundle install@

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

@$ gem list --local@

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h2. Configure Mongoid

Mongoid provides access to the MongoDB database from Rails.

You can use the default configuration found in the file *config/mongoid.yml*.

If you want to see what's in your MongoDB databases, I recommend using the "MongoHub":http://mongohub.todayclose.com/ app (for Mac OS X).

h2. Configure Email

You must configure the app for your email account if you want your application to send email messages, for example, if you've generated the application with the option to install the Devise @:confirmable@ module. 

h4. Use a Gmail account

If you've generated the application with the option to use a Gmail account to send email, you'll need to modify the files *config/environments/development.rb* and *config/environments/production.rb* to include your Gmail username and password.

<pre>
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  domain: "example.com",
  authentication: "plain",
  enable_starttls_auto: true,
  user_name: ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"],
  password: ENV["GMAIL_PASSWORD"]
}
</pre>

You can replace @ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]@ and @ENV["GMAIL_PASSWORD"]@ with your Gmail username and password. However, committing the file to a public GitHub repository will expose your secret password.

If you're familiar with setting "Unix environment variables":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable, it's advisable to leave @config.action_mailer.smtp_settings@ unchanged and set your environment variables in the file that is read when starting an interactive shell (the *~/.bashrc* file for the bash shell). This will keep the password out of your repository.

Are you using a bash shell? Use @echo $SHELL@ to find out. For a bash shell, edit the *~/.bashrc* file and add:

<pre>
export GMAIL_USERNAME="myname@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_PASSWORD="secret*"
</pre>

Open a new shell or restart your terminal application to continue.

h4. Configure ActionMailer

The example application is set to deliver email in both development and production. It will raise delivery errors in development but not production. 

In development, @config.action_mailer.default_url_options@ is set for a host at @localhost:3000@ which will enable links in Devise confirmation email messages to work properly. You'll need to change the @config.action_mailer.default_url_options@ host option from @example.com@ to your own domain for the production environment.

You can change these values as needed in the *config/environments/development.rb* and *config/environments/production.rb* files.

h4. Configure Devise for Email

Complete your email configuration by modifying

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

and setting the @config.mailer_sender@ option for the return email address for messages that Devise sends from the application.

h2. Configure Devise

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

h2. Create a Default User

h4. Set Up a Database Seed File

You'll want to set up a default user so you can easily log in to test the app. You can modify the file *db/seeds.rb* for your own name, email and password:

<pre>
puts 'EMPTY THE MONGODB DATABASE'
Mongoid.master.collections.reject { |c| c.name =~ /^system/}.each(&:drop)
puts 'SETTING UP DEFAULT USER LOGIN'
user = User.create! :name => 'First User', :email => 'user@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user.name
user2 = User.create! :name => 'Second User', :email => 'user2@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user2.name
</pre>

Use the defaults or change the values for name, email, and password as you wish.

h4. Set the Database

Prepare the database and add the default user to the database by running the commands:

<pre>
$ bundle exec rake db:seed
</pre>

Set the database for running tests:

<pre>
$ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

h4. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

To sign in as the default user, (unless you've changed it) use

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You should delete or change the pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here are "instructions for deploying your app to Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

h2. Customizing

"Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise provides a variety of features for implementing authentication. See the Devise documentation for options.

This example application and tutorial demonstrates Devise and Mongoid working together on Rails 3. Add any models, controllers, and views that you need.

h2. Testing

The application contains RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and steps. The tests are minimal and can be improved.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios and steps.
