h1. !http://railsapps.github.com/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Application for Devise with Mongoid)! Rails App for Devise with Mongoid

Rails 3.2 example application shows how to use Devise with Mongoid.

* "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management.
* MongoDB is used as a datastore with the "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/  gem for quick development without schemas or migrations.

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-mongoid-devise.html to show how it's built.

You can build this application in only a few minutes using the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool.

h2. !http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/t_logo-a.png(Follow on Twitter)!:http://www.twitter.com/rails_apps Follow on Twitter

Follow the project on Twitter: "@rails_apps":http://twitter.com/rails_apps. Please tweet some praise if you like what you've found.

h2. Tutorial

A complete tutorial is available:

h4. "View the Tutorial":http://railsapps.github.com/tutorial-rails-mongoid-devise.html

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. See a list of recommended resources for "Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/rails.html.

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

This is a demonstration application that allows you to visit a home page and see a list of users. With the default user's email and password (supplied below), you can log in and view details for each user. You can customize this app as you need.

The @rake db:seed@ command sets up a database with two example users. The first user is designated as an administrator and can view a administrative page when logged in. The second user is restricted from accessing the administrative page.

h4. Similar Examples and Tutorials

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.com/. See a list of additional "Rails examples, tutorials, and starter apps":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-examples-tutorials.html.

This example application uses the Mongoid ORM with the MongoDB datastore. You can use ActiveRecord and a SQLite database instead. The "rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber example app and tutorial shows how to set up Devise with ActiveRecord and SQLite.

For an extended version of this example that adds "CanCan":https://github.com/ryanb/cancan for authorization (controlling access to administrative pages) and "Twitter Bootstrap":http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ (for CSS styling) see the "rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-bootstrap-devise-cancan example application.

The "rails-prelaunch-signup":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup example and tutorial from the RailsApps project is also similar to this example application.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.9.3)
* Rails 3.2
* A working installation of "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org/ (version 1.6.0 or newer)

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html for advice about updating Rails and your development environment.

h4. Installing MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed on your computer, you'll need to install it and set it up to be always running on your computer (run at launch). On Mac OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to install "Homebrew":http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ and then run the following:

<pre>
brew install mongodb
</pre>

Homebrew will provide post-installation instructions to get MongoDB running. The last line of the installation output shows you the MongoDB install location (for example, */usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/1.8.0-x86_64*). You'll find the MongoDB configuration file there. After an installation using Homebrew, the default data directory will be */usr/local/var/mongodb*.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code.

h3. Fork

If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

h3. Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails3-mongoid-devise.git
</pre>
  
You'll need "git":http://git-scm.com/ on your machine. See "Rails and Git":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-git.html.

h3. Generate

If you want to use the project as a starter app, use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you many additional options.

To build the example application, run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb -T -O
</pre>

Use the @-T -O@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Active Record files.

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

This creates a new Rails app (with the name "myapp") on your computer.

h3. Edit the README

If you're storing the app in a GitHub repository, please edit the README files to add a description of the app and your contact info. If you don't change the README, people will think I am the author of your version of the application.

h2. Getting Started

h3. Install the Required Gems

Check the Gemfile to see which gems are used by this application.

If you used the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-composer/ tool to generate the example app, the application template script has already run the @bundle install@ command.

If not, you should run the @bundle install@ command to install the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.com/installing-rails.html.

h3. Configure Mongoid

Mongoid provides access to the MongoDB database from Rails.

You can use the default configuration found in the file *config/mongoid.yml*.

If you want to see what's in your MongoDB databases, I recommend using the "MongoHub":http://mongohub.todayclose.com/ app (for Mac OS X).

h3. Configure Email

You must configure the app for your email account if you want your application to send email messages. 

h4. Use a Gmail account

You'll need to modify two files to include your Gmail username and password:

* *config/environments/development.rb*
* *config/environments/production.rb*

<pre>
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  domain: "example.com",
  authentication: "plain",
  enable_starttls_auto: true,
  user_name: ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"],
  password: ENV["GMAIL_PASSWORD"]
}
</pre>

You can replace @ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]@ and @ENV["GMAIL_PASSWORD"]@ with your Gmail username and password. However, committing the file to a public GitHub repository will expose your secret password.

If you're familiar with setting "Unix environment variables":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable, it's advisable to leave @config.action_mailer.smtp_settings@ unchanged and set your environment variables in the file that is read when starting an interactive shell (the *~/.bashrc* file for the bash shell). This will keep the password out of your repository.

Are you using a bash shell? Use @echo $SHELL@ to find out. For a bash shell, edit the *~/.bashrc* file and add:

<pre>
export GMAIL_USERNAME="myname@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_PASSWORD="secret*"
</pre>

Open a new shell or restart your terminal application to continue.

h4. Configure ActionMailer

The example application is set to deliver email in production only. It will raise delivery errors in development but not production. 

In development, @config.action_mailer.default_url_options@ is set for a host at @localhost:3000@ which will enable links in Devise confirmation email messages to work properly. You'll need to change the @config.action_mailer.default_url_options@ host option from @example.com@ to your own domain for the production environment.

You can change these values as needed in these two files:

* *config/environments/development.rb*
* *config/environments/production.rb*

h4. Configure Devise for Email

Complete your email configuration by modifying

* *config/initializers/devise.rb*

and setting the @config.mailer_sender@ option for the return email address for messages that Devise sends from the application.

h2. Configure Devise

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

* *config/initializers/devise.rb*

h2. Create a Default User

h3. Set Up a Database Seed File

You'll want to set up a default user so you can easily log in to test the app. You can modify the file *db/seeds.rb* for your own name, email and password:

<pre>
puts 'SETTING UP DEFAULT USER LOGIN'
user = User.create! :name => 'First User', :email => 'user@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user.name
user2 = User.create! :name => 'Second User', :email => 'user2@example.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user2.name
</pre>

Use the defaults or change the values for name, email, and password as you wish.

h3. Set the Database

Prepare the database and add the default user to the database by running the commands:

<pre>
$ rake db:seed
</pre>

Set the database for running tests:

<pre>
$ rake db:test:prepare
</pre>

If you’re not using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, you should preface each rake command with @bundle exec@. You don’t need to use @bundle exec@ if you are using rvm version 1.11.0 or newer.

h3. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

To sign in as the default user, (unless you've changed it) use

* email: user@example.com
* password: please

You should delete or change the pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

If you test the app by starting the web server and then leave the server running while you install new gems, you’ll have to restart the server to see any changes. The same is true for changes to configuration files in the config folder. This can be confusing to new Rails developers because you can change files in the app folders without restarting the server. Stop the server each time after testing and you will avoid this issue.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here are "instructions for deploying your app to Heroku":http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

h2. Customizing

"Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise provides a variety of features for implementing authentication. See the Devise documentation for options.

This example application and tutorial demonstrates Devise and Mongoid working together on Rails 3. Add any models, controllers, and views that you need.

h2. Testing

The example application contains a suite of RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and step definitions.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.
